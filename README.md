 The eyes will follow user's mouse movement

Description of Project:
The Eye exercise demonstrates whenever you move the mouse position within the browser, the two eyes element will automaticaly follow the position of your mouse on the page.

How to Run:
No software installation is needed. After the web page is loaded, you just need to click your mouse anywhere on the page to start the program.
